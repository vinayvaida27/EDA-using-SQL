## Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data science that helps in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. This project demonstrates how to use SQL for EDA, providing a series of queries that can be used to analyze different datasets.

## Files in the Repository
The repository contains the following SQL files:

- **Data Exploration.sql**: This file contains various SQL queries to explore and analyze datasets. It includes operations such as data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.
- **Walmart Analysis Query.sql**: This file contains SQL queries specifically tailored to analyze a Walmart dataset. It includes sales analysis, trend identification, and performance metrics.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have a working installation of an SQL database. You can use any SQL database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

### Prerequisites
- SQL Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- Basic understanding of SQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vinayvaida27/EDA-using-SQL.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd EDA-using-SQL
    ```

## Usage
You can run the SQL scripts provided in the repository to perform EDA on your datasets. Here are the steps:

1. Open your SQL database client.
2. Load your dataset into the database.
3. Execute the queries from the `Data Exploration.sql` or `Walmart Analysis Query.sql` files.

### Example
For example, to run the `Walmart Analysis Query.sql`:
1. Open the SQL file in your database client.
2. Run each query sequentially to analyze the Walmart dataset.
